##I have developed an interactive quiz application using basic web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as part of my internship task. The main aim of this task is to understand how JavaScript can be used to build interactive and dynamic web applications. This project focuses on creating a simple quiz system where users can answer questions and receive instant feedback along with score calculation.

In this project, HTML is used to create the basic structure of the quiz application. It includes elements such as the quiz title, question display area, multiple choice option buttons, feedback message section, score display, and a next button to move to the following question. HTML helps in organizing the content on the webpage in a clear and structured manner so that users can easily interact with the quiz.

CSS is used to design and style the quiz application. Simple styles are applied to improve the appearance of the quiz, such as background color, font styling, button design, spacing, and alignment. The design is kept simple and clean so that the application is easy to understand and user-friendly. CSS helps in making the quiz visually appealing without adding unnecessary complexity.

JavaScript is the core part of this project and is used to handle all the quiz logic. The quiz questions are stored in an array, where each question contains the question text, multiple options, and the correct answer. JavaScript functions are used to load questions dynamically, check the selected answer, display instant feedback such as “Correct Answer” or “Wrong Answer”, and update the score accordingly.

When the quiz starts, the first question is automatically displayed on the screen. The user selects an answer by clicking on one of the option buttons. As soon as the option is selected, the application checks whether the answer is correct or not. If the answer is correct, the score is increased, and a correct message is shown. If the answer is wrong, a wrong answer message is displayed immediately. This instant feedback helps the user understand their performance while attempting the quiz.

The “Next” button allows the user to move to the next question. The application keeps track of the current question number and loads the next question until all questions are completed. After the final question, a message indicating that the quiz is finished is shown along with the final score.

The entire project is developed in a basic and beginner-friendly way with separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. This separation of files helps in better understanding the role of each technology and follows good coding practices.

Through this task, I learned important concepts such as JavaScript arrays, functions, conditional statements, event handling, and DOM manipulation. This project helped me improve my logical thinking and practical understanding of how interactive web applications are built using JavaScript.##
